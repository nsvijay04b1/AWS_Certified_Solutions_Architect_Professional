# AWS Secrets Manager:
- Enables you to replace hardcoded credentials in your code, including passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. 
- Provides this flexibility by storing the secret as key-value pairs of text strings. 
- Supports versioning.
- Can automatically rotate the secret for you according to a specified schedule. This enables you to replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, significantly reducing the risk of compromise.
- Supports binary data in the secret.
- Access control enforced by AWS IAM: use identity-based or resource-based policies.
- Uses KMS Envelope Encryption: secrets can be encrypted by a data key generated by KMS. The encrypted data key is stored with the secret. Secret Manager uses KMS to decrypt the data key when needed.
- Sensitive data stored in AWS Secrets Manager secrets can be exposed to an ECS container or to an AWS Batch job as environment variables or as part of the log configuration.
