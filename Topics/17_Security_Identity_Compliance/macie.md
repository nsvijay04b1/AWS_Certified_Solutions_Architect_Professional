# Amazon Macie:
- A fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to help you discover, monitor, and protect your sensitive data in AWS. 
- Automates the discovery of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, to provide you with a better understanding of the data that your organization stores in Amazon S3. 
- Macie also provides you with an inventory of your S3 buckets, and it automatically evaluates and monitors those buckets for security and access control. 
- Within minutes, Macie can identify and report overly permissive or unencrypted buckets for your organization.
