# Amazon Macie:
- A fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to help you discover, monitor, and protect your sensitive data in AWS. 
- Automates the discovery of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, to provide you with a better understanding of the data that your organization stores in Amazon S3. 
- Macie also provides you with an inventory of your S3 buckets, and it automatically evaluates and monitors those buckets for security and access control. 
- Within minutes, Macie can identify and report overly permissive or unencrypted buckets for your organization. 

- It is a data security and data privacy service
- Macie is a service to discover, monitor and protect data stored in S3 buckets
- Once enabled and pointed to buckets, Macie will automatically discover data and categorize it as PII, PHI, Finance etc.
- Macie is using data identifier. There are 2 types of data identifier:
    - Managed Data Identifier: built-in, can use machine learning, pattern matching to analyze and discover data. It is designed to detect sensitive data from many countries
    - Custom Data Identifier: created by clients, they are proprietary to accounts and they are regex based
- Discovery Jobs: these jobs will use data identifiers to manage and search for sensitive content. They will generate findings which can be used for integration with other AWS service (ex: Event Bridge) in order to do automatic remediation
- Macie uses multi account architecture: one account is the master account which can manage other accounts to discover sensitive data

### Macie Identifiers

- Data Discovery Jobs: analyzes data in order to determine wether the objects contain sensitive data. This is done using data identifiers
- **Managed Data Identifiers**:
    - Created and managed by AWS
    - Can be used to detect a growing list of common sensitive data types: credentials, financial data, health data, personal identifiers (addresses, passports, etc.)
- **Custom Data Identifiers**:
    - Can be created by us, AWS account users/owners
    - They are using regex patterns to match data
    - We can add optional keywords: optional sequences that need to be in the proximity to regex match
    - Maximum Match Distance: how close keywords are to regex pattern
    - We can also include ignore words

### Macie Findings

- Macie will produce 2 types of findings:
    - **Policy Findings**: are generated when the policies or settings are changed in a way that reduces the security of the bucket after Macie is enabled
    - **Sensitive Data Findings**: generated when sensitive data is identified based on identifiers
