# Amazon Inspector:
- Assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.
- Assessments can be automated to integrate with deployment pipelines.
- Optional agent on EC2 instances: collects installed package information and software configuration.
- You can use Amazon Inspector to assess your assessment targets (collections of AWS resources) for potential security issues and vulnerabilities.
- Compares the behavior and the security configuration of the assessment targets to selected security rules packages. 
- A rule is a security check that Amazon Inspector performs during the assessment run.
- Rules are grouped into distinct rules packages either by category, severity, or pricing.
