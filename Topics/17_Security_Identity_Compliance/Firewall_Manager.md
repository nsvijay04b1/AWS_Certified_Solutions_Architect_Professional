# AWS Firewall Manager:
- Simplifies your administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources for AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, Amazon VPC security groups, and AWS Network Firewall. 
- You set up your AWS WAF firewall rules, Shield Advanced protections, Amazon VPC security groups, and Network Firewall firewalls just once. The service automatically applies the rules and protections across your accounts and resources, even as you add new resources. 
- Helps to protect all resources with specific tags.
