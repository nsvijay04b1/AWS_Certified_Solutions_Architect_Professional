# AWS Migration Hub:
- Provides a single place to discover your existing servers, plan migrations, and track the status of each application migration. 
- Provides visibility into your application portfolio and streamlines planning and tracking. 
- You can visualize the connections and the status of the servers and databases that make up each of the applications you are migrating, regardless of which migration tool you are using.
- Gives you the choice to start migrating right away and group servers while migration is underway, or to first discover servers and then group them into applications. Either way, you can migrate each server in an application and track progress from each tool in the AWS Migration Hub. 
- Supports migration status updates from the following AWS services:
	- AWS Database Migration Service
	- AWS Server Migration Service
	- CloudEndure Migration
