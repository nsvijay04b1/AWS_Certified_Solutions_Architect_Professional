# AWS Wavelength:
- Deploys standard AWS compute and storage services to the edge of telecommunication carriers' 5G networks.
- Developers can extend an Amazon VPC to one or more Wavelength Zones, and then use AWS resources like EC2 instances to run applications that require ultra-low latency and a connection to AWS services in the Region.
