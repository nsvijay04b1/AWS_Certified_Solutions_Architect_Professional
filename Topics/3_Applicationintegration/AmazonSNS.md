Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS):
- A managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers). 
- Push-push mechanism.
- Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. 
- Each subscriber receives its own copy of each published message.
- Two types of subscribers:
	- Application to Application subscribers: Kinesis Data Firehose, SQS, AWS Lambda and HTTP/S. Through Kinesis Data Firehose, you can fan out SNS notifications to S3, Redshift and 3rd party services.
	- Application to Person subscribers: email, mobile push notifications, and SMS. 
- A subscriber can assign a filter policy to the topic subscription. Can filter on JSON fields.
- Two Topic types:
	- Standard: use when message delivery order and possible message duplication are not critical. 
	- FIFO: use to ensure strict message ordering, to define message groups, and to prevent message duplication. Only Amazon SQS FIFO queues can subscribe to a FIFO topic.
- Published messages are stored across multiple, geographically separated servers and data centers.
- If a subscribed endpoint isn't available, Amazon SNS runs a delivery retry policy.
- To preserve any messages that aren't delivered before the delivery retry policy ends, you can create a dead-letter queue in SQS.
- Message attributes let you provide any arbitrary metadata about the message.
- You can choose to deliver raw messages (not wrapped in a structure).
- Supports Encryption at rest.
