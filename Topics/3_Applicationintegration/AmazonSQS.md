Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS):
- offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components. 
- Push-pull mechanism.
- You control who can send messages to and receive messages from an Amazon SQS queue.
- Two Queue types:
	- Standard: Best effort ordering, at-least-once message delivery, unlimited throughput.
	- FIFO: FIFO ordering, exactly-once message processing, limited throughput: 300 API calls per second, up to 10 messages per API call. So max is 3,000 messages per second.
- Messages:
	- Each message gets a Message ID.
	- You can use message attributes to attach custom metadata to messages. 
	- Max size: 256 KB.
	- A message can be a pointer to an S3 or DynamoDB object.
	- Messages are stored on multiple servers.
	- Retention period: 1mn to 14 days. Default is 4 days.
	- Messages can be protected by Server-Side Encryption using KMS.
- Concurrency:
	- Multiple producers and consumers can use the same queue at the same time. 
	- When a message is received/collected by a consumer, it remains in the queue.
	- To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. Can be 0 sec to 12 hours. Default is 30 seconds. The consumer should delete the message from the queue after processing it.
- Short Polling & Long Polling:
	- SQS provides short polling (no wait) and long polling (with wait) to receive messages from a queue.
	- By default, queues use short polling.
- Short Polling:
	- The ReceiveMessage request queries only a subset of the servers (based on a weighted random distribution) to find messages that are available to include in the response. 
	- Amazon SQS sends the response right away, even if the query found no messages.
	- To set Short polling: either in the queue parameter (WaitTimeSeconds = 0) or the request parameter (ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds = 0).
- Long Polling:
	- The ReceiveMessage request queries all of the servers for messages. 
	- SQS sends a response after it collects at least one available message, up to the maximum number of messages specified in the request. 
	- SQS sends an empty response only if the polling wait time expires. 
	- The maximum long polling wait time is 20 seconds.
	- Long polling helps reduce the cost of using Amazon SQS by eliminating the number of empty responses.
- Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of seconds.
- Message timers let you specify an initial invisibility period for a message added to a queue.
- A dead-letter queue is a queue that one or more source queues can use for messages that are not consumed successfully. 
- Supports SSE using KMS CMKs.
- Supports anonymous access.
- Lambda Triggers:
	- Lambda polls the queue and invokes your Lambda function synchronously with an event that contains queue messages.
	- Lambda reads messages in batches and invokes your function once for each batch: the event that is passed to your function contains all read messages.
	- You can set the batch size: number of messages that Lambda will collect at once.
	- You can set the batch window: period that Lambda should wait to collect the messages before invoking your function. Max = 5mn.
	- Lambda continues to poll messages from the SQS standard queue until batch window expires, the payload limit is reached or full batch size is reached. 
	- When your function successfully processes a batch, Lambda deletes its messages from the queue.
