# AWS Step Functions:
- A serverless orchestration service that lets you combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications.
- Through Step Functions' graphical console, you see your applicationâ€™s workflow as a series of event-driven steps. 
- Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks.
- A state machine is a workflow.
- Each step in a workflow is a state. 
- The workflow is written using the Amazon States Language (JSON formatted).
- Two types of state machines/workflows: 
	- Standard workflow: can run for up to 1 year, up to 2,000 executions per second, employs an at-most-once model.
	- Express workflow: can run for up to 5 minutes, up to 100,000 executions per second, employs an at-least-once model (can have duplicate executions). A popular use case is ingesting high throughput IoT messages.
- A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of work that another AWS service performs.
- Callback tasks:
	- Callback tasks provide a way to pause a workflow until a task token is returned. 
	- A task might need to wait for a human approval, integrate with a third party, or call legacy systems.
