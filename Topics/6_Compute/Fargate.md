# AWS Fargate:
- Fargate is a serverless compute engine that you can use to run containers for ECS, EKS and AWS Batch. 
- Fargate removes the need to provision, scale and manage EC2 instances.
- Fargate allocates the right amount of compute, eliminating the need to choose instances and scale cluster capacity.
- Fargate runs each task or pod in its own kernel providing the tasks and pods their own isolated compute environment (isolation by design).
