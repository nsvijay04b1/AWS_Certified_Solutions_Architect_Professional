# AWS Outposts:
- A fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to customer premises. 
- An Outpost is a pool of AWS compute and storage capacity deployed at a customer site. 
- AWS offers multiple Outposts hardware configurations (sizings).
- Form factor: 42U rack.
- AWS operates, monitors, and manages this capacity as part of an AWS Region. 
- Each Outpost is an extension of an Availability Zone and its associated Region. 
- Each Outpost can support multiple VPCs that can have one or more Outpost subnets.
- You can create subnets on your Outpost and specify them when you create AWS resources such as EC2 instances, EBS volumes, ECS clusters, and RDS instances.
- Instances in Outpost subnets communicate with other instances in the AWS Region using private IP addresses, all within the same VPC. 
- Your on-premises network must provide wide area network (WAN) access back to the Region and to the internet. 
- Local gateway: 
	- Logical interconnect virtual router that enables communication between your Outpost and your on-premises network (NAT and BGP advertisement). 
	- Can also be used for outbound internet traffic.
- VPC private connectivity options (Outpost to AWS):
	- service links: an encrypted set of VPN connections that are used whenever the Outpost communicates with your chosen home Region. 
	- local gateway: the local gateway sends traffic through an existing Direct Connect or S2S VPN.
- Customers can also deploy multiple Outposts at a site, each tied to a different Availability Zone for even higher availability.
