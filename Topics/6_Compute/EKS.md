# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):
- Gives you the flexibility to start, run, and scale Kubernetes clusters in the AWS cloud or on-premises. 
- automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates. 
- Can run on EC2 or AWS Fargate.
- EKS runs the Kubernetes control plane across three Availability Zones in order to ensure high availability, and it automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes.
- EKS supports running Windows worker nodes alongside Linux worker nodes in the same cluster.
