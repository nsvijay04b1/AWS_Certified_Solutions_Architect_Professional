# CloudTrail:
- Is an AWS service that records actions in AWS that were taken by any user, role or service.
- Is enabled at the account level.
- Events types:
	- Management events = control plane events.
	- Data events = data plane events. Supported on few services only (S3, Lambda).
	- Insights = unusual activity in your AWS account.
- Events history:
	- You can view, search, and download the past 90 days of activity in your AWS account.
	- Events download file formats: CSV or JSON. 
	- To keep more history, configure a trail that stores events to S3 or CLoudWatch Logs.
- CloudTrail trails:
	- A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events to an Amazon S3 bucket, CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Events.
	- Enables you to archive, analyze, and respond to changes in your AWS resources.
	- A trail can limit the scope of events.
	- A trail can be applied to all regions.
	- If you use AWS Organizations, the Master Account can apply a trail to the whole organization.
- Events delivery time:
	- Logs are delivered within an average of about 15 minutes of an API call. No SLA.
	- Events are delivered to the CloudWatch Events bus in near-realtime.
- Delivering log files to S3:
	- Log files are compressed JSON files.
	- Log files can be encrypted.
	- A trail can send an SNS notification upon log file delivery.
	- You can enable "log file validation": validates that the log files have not been modified/replaced.
- A trail can be applied to all Regions or a single Region.
- For global services such as IAM, STS, and CloudFront, events are delivered to any trail that includes global services (--include-global-service-events option).
- To create an alarm on some API activity, you should create a trail that sends the events to CloudWatch Logs and create an alarm in CloudWatch Logs.
