# AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM):
- An open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS.
- A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks.
- A serverless application is more than just a Lambda functionâ€”it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings. 
- SAM template specification: 
	- You define your serverless application with a simple and clean syntax to describe the functions, APIs, permissions, configurations, and events that make up a serverless application. 
	- SAM is an extension of CloudFormation: you can define resources by using CloudFormation in your SAM template.
- SAM CLI: 
	- You build serverless applications that are defined by SAM templates.
	- The CLI provides a Lambda-like execution environment locally for testing and debugging.
- You can publish or use server less applications in the AWS Serverless Application Repository.
