# Amazon EventBridge:
- A serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources. 
- Allows you to build event driven architectures, which are loosely coupled and distributed. 
- Delivers a near real-time stream of events from:
	- System events that describe changes in AWS resources.
	- Events from you own applications.
	- SaaS partners like Salesforce.com.
- Events:
	- Events in Amazon EventBridge are represented as JSON objects. 
	- All events have a similar structure, and the same top-level fields. 
	- A target receives events in JSON format. 
- Event Buses:
	- Streams of events are collected in event buses. 
	- CloudWatch Events: one event bus that is included by default for system events from AWS services.
- Targets:
	- Supported targets include: EC2, ECS, Lambda, Batch, Step Functions, SNS, SQS, Streams in Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Data Firehose.
	- A rule's targets must be in the same Region as the rule.
- Rules:
	- A rule matches incoming events and routes them to one or more targets for processing. 
	- A single rule can route to multiple targets, all of which are processed in parallel. 
	- A rule can customize the JSON sent to the target.
- To preserve any messages that aren't delivered before the delivery retry policy ends, you can create a dead-letter queue in SQS.
