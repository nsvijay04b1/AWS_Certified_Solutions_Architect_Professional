# Transit Gateway (TGW):
- Acts as a Regional virtual router for traffic flowing between your VPCs and on-premises networks. 
- Scales elastically based on the volume of network traffic.
- Transit gateways are highly available by design. You do not need additional transit gateways for high availability.
- Routing through a transit gateway operates at layer 3. 
- Supports Site-to-Site VPN connections (AWS VPN).
- Supports multicast.
- Supported "attachments":
	- One or more VPCs,
	- Direct Connect Gateway
	- Peering connection with another transit gateway (must be in another region),
	- A VPN Connection
	- "Connect" SD-WAN or third party network appliance.
- To use a Transit gateway in a VPC: 
	- You need to attach it to a subnet.
	- The transit gateway places a network interface in that subnet using one IP address from the subnet. 
	- Once attached to a subnet (max 1 subnet per AZ), traffic can be routed to all subnets in that Availability Zone, not just the specified subnet. This is called « Enabling the AZ ».
	- To be able to use the transit gateway in all the subnets of a VPC, you need to attach the transit gateway to one subnet in each Availability Zone.
	- Resources that reside in Availability Zones where there is no transit gateway attachment will not be able to reach the transit gateway. 
- Route table:
	- A transit gateway has a default route table and can optionally have additional route tables. 
	- The target of the routes could be any transit gateway attachment. 
	- By default, transit gateway attachments are associated with the default transit gateway route table. 
	- Each attachment is associated with exactly one route table. 
- Number of transit gateways per Region per account: 5.
- Maximum bandwidth:
	- Burst per VPC, Direct Connect gateway, or peered transit gateway connection: 50 Gbps
	- Per VPN tunnel: 1.25 Gbps. You can use ECMP to get higher VPN bandwidth by aggregating multiple VPN tunnels.
